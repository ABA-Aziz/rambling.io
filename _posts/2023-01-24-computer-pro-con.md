# Benefits of Computing

## Information

Computers hold all of humankind's knowledge. To know how to use one means that you have access to everything.

## Fun

Let's face it. Computers are fun. And if you know how to use one, it'll be even more fun because you're the one doing the stuff people love.

## Communication

Computers being connected since the advent of the Internet means that people all over the world can communicate with each other, and learn about different cultures.

# Cons of Computing

## Privacy

The advent of social media, allowing for better communication among people has been abused by companies like Facebook, LG and Samsung who sell the data of its users to advertisers, as a massive breach of privacy

## Hacking

Computing makes it easy to hack into other computers. Hacking is the act of gaining unauthorized access to another computer, often to steal information or give the target malware. The 1983 film War Games created the first anti-hacking laws after President Ronald Reagan learned it would be very easy to hack into the United States military. In 2019, Swiss developer maia arson crimew released the United States' No Fly List after hacking into their servers, leading to the Swiss government raiding her and her parents' houses.

## Difficulty Spike

There can be a large increase in difficulty for novice programmers that can make it hard for them to break into the field. The jump from html and css to things like C++ can be jarring to new programmers.
