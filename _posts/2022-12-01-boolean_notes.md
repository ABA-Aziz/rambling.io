# Conditionals

## Selection

### Selection

What CollegeBoard calls conditionals

### Algorithm

## Conditional Statements

"if" statements or "if else" statements, which have two outcomes. Conditional statements only have one.

Else will only execute if "if" is false.

### Nested Conditionals

Conditionals inside conditionals for more outcomes

if etc:
    if etc2:
        whatever
    else:
        something something
else:
    some other thing
