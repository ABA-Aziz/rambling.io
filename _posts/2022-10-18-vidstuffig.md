# Script

Okay, let's do this thing. We're working on Jeopardy, everything is in progress. 

## Software Development

### Life Cycle

We started with coming up with ideas. And by that I mean me and Leonard came up with ideas while Jonathan gave his opinions on some of them. We eventually decided on my idea of a Jeopardy-style game. We then spent a long while discussing the aesthetics and the questions. I started a concept sheet to come up with questions and ways to figure everything out. Of the 49 questions we ended up using, I wrote 41, Jonathan wrote 5 and Leonard wrote 3. We then programmed for format and databases.

### Updates

We mark our progress through major breakthrougs. Uploading the sounds to use in the files, finishing the dictionary, etc. We mark the changelog through these. Version 1.0 is the initial thing. 1.1 is when we started uploading, 2.0 when the dictionary is done, and 3.0 when the sounds were added.

### Agile Process

We searched up Jeopardy for how to make the board. When I was surfing the internet, I found the sounds we could use, and I'm pretty sure Toei doesn't trademark those sounds because they're from before 2012 so they're not songs. 

## Requirements

### Computer Specs

The game was mostly developed on a 2020 Lenovo Legion 5 on an i7 core. This is as much information that I could glean.

### Tracking

I have a scrum board.

### Speedrun Strats

I asked a bunch of people the questions we have to determine difficulty, and we held daily meetings over how to go over things. The Jeopardy theme song is copyrighted, for example, so we had to use other sounds. I got a bunch of sounds off the internet that I don't think Toei will mind if we use, considering they haven't taken down the videos yet, and the sounds are from 2003 and 2004. 

## Demo

### Github Issues

We don't have that.

### Expectations

We have a table of buttons, and when you click one, it goes to a question that you must answer. If wrong, it plays the mp3 files "Standing By 1" and when correct, plays "Turn Up 1".
