# 3a

## 3ai

The program shows information of a triangle after inputing 3 side lengths. After the input, it shows possible angle measurements and the resulting sine, cosine, tanget, secant, cosecant and cotangent.

1/1

## 3aii

Unfortunately, the program does not show the right triangle formula, as it uses random angles that would allow the trianlge to work, even in perfect right triangles. While the code does ask if A**2 + B**2 = C**2 and variations of the formula, it will perform a certain task, but it doesn't. So that's a whole thing that someone more articulate will have to get into.
