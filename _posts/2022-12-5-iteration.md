Set - collection that is unordered and unchangeable no duplicaes
Dictionary - ordered, changeable, no duplicates
### Terms

Elements - values assigned to an index
# Iteration

## What not to do

print everything out

## What is it?

Repetition of a process or utterance applied to the result or taken from a previous statemtn. There's a lot of typeso f iteration, though, so what to use? Some methods are for loops.

When an object is *iterable* when it can be used in an *iteration*
When passed through the fuction iter() it returns as an *iterator*

## Loops

Loops essentially automate lists.

range() will save even more time
most code starts with 0

*else, elif and break* are functions that can be used.
else
else if
break.
