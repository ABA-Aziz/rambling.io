3) What is the capital of Pakistan?

# The Process

We spent the first day just working on the design of the whole thing, picking countries, finding cities, debating on how to spell Bras/zil, etc. 

We then started work on the code itself. While it mostly went by without a hitch, we hit a roadblock near the end. The results page wouldn't show your results! It would show things like *0/3*, *__/3*, and even *undefined/3*. After nearly a full day of trying to rectify the problem, using code that wasn't even offered to us, and asking others on Slack, we figured out it was because the results were decided before the test started! So, I figured out if we made getting to the results its own event, we could control when the results are recorded. Leonard made it when you mouseover the whole thing, and voila! A 3 question quiz about capitals of the world!!
