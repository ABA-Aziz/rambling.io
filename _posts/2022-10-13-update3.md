# Update 2.0

## Overview

Okay, it's not actually version 2.0, but we got an API to do the thing. We're currently trying to figure out how to categorize the difficulty of the questions. I tried asking some people who sit next to us, but results were...disappointing. I'm considering asking someone else, but I really don't feel like doing that.

## Work
API has been found. Trivia by API-Ninjas, which was found by our DevOp Leonard Wright. I've been on top of the Scrum Board, and I'm honestly not sure what Martin and Jonathan have done so far. Martin has volunteered to write a few of the backup questions for other rounds, but I feel that was mostly because he has done literally nothing and doesn't want his grade to go down. He is a developer, though, so that should be fun for him.

## Problems

We've been trying to find a way to get the whole thing to work. It pushes but doesn't pull or vice versa. On a personal note, my github doesn't accept things from here for some reason. So...yeah.
