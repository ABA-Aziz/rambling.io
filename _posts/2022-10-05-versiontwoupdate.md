# Update 1.1

## Questions

For the final project the four of us have to do, we did a Jeopardy type game, but with 49 questions instead of 25. We all wrote them. And by that, I mean I wrote 41, Jonathan wrote 5, Leonard wrote 3, and Martin wrote 0. I'm not bitter. Nope. We still have to actually program it though, but I think the "tabulate" thing on Python should help with that. We also need to think of the aesthetics, because a silent game with no...vibes...is boring.

## Work

I've been trying to find an API to do some work on. So far, my efforts have been fruitless, but I will persist, because if I want to advance in this whole thing then I will have to try.

## AWS

AWS hates me. Can't do anything about it in school wi fi or home wi fi.
