            "content": "Script . Okay, let’s do this thing. We’re working on Jeopardy, everything is in progress. . Software Development . Life Cycle . We started with coming up with ideas. And by that I mean me and Leonard came up with ideas while Jonathan gave his opinions on some of them. We eventually decided on my idea of a Jeopardy-style game. We then spent a long while discussing the aesthetics and the questions. I started a concept sheet to come up with questions and ways to figure everything out. Of the 49 questions we ended up using, I wrote 41, Jonathan wrote 5 and Leonard wrote 3. We then programmed for format and databases. . Updates . We mark our progress through major breakthrougs. Uploading the sounds to use in the files, finishing the dictionary, etc. We mark the changelog through these. Version 1.0 is the initial thing. 1.1 is when we started uploading, 2.0 when the dictionary is done, and 3.0 when the sounds were added. . Agile Process . We searched up Jeopardy for how to make the board. When I was surfing the internet, I found the sounds we could use, and I’m pretty sure Toei doesn’t trademark those sounds because they’re from before 2012 so they’re not songs. . Requirements . Computer Specs . The game was mostly developed on a 2020 Lenovo Legion 5 on an i7 core. This is as much information that I could glean. . Tracking . I have a scrum board. . Speedrun Strats . I asked a bunch of people the questions we have to determine difficulty, and we held daily meetings over how to go over things. The Jeopardy theme song is copyrighted, for example, so we had to use other sounds. I got a bunch of sounds off the internet that I don’t think Toei will mind if we use, considering they haven’t taken down the videos yet, and the sounds are from 2003 and 2004. . Demo . Github Issues . We don’t have that. . Expectations . We have a table of buttons, and when you click one, it goes to a question that you must answer. If wrong, it plays the mp3 files “Standing By 1” and when correct, plays “Turn Up 1”. .",

I’m considering asking someone else, but I really don’t feel like doing that. . Work . API has been found. Trivia by API-Ninjas, which was found by our DevOp Leonard Wright. I’ve been on top of the Scrum Board, and I’m honestly not sure what Martin and Jonathan have done so far. Martin has volunteered to write a few of the backup questions for other rounds, but I feel that was mostly because he has done literally nothing and doesn’t want his grade to go down. He is a developer, though, so that should be fun for him. . Problems . We’ve been trying to find a way to get the whole thing to work. It pushes but doesn’t pull or vice versa. On a personal note, my github doesn’t accept things from here for some reason. So…yeah. .",

And by that, I mean I wrote 41, Jonathan wrote 5, Leonard wrote 3, and Martin wrote 0. I’m not bitter. Nope. We still have to actually program it though, but I think the “tabulate” thing on Python should help with that. We also need to think of the aesthetics, because a silent game with no…vibes…is boring. . Work . I’ve been trying to find an API to do some work on.

The Process . We spent the first day just working on the design of the whole thing, picking countries, finding cities, debating on how to spell Bras/zil, etc. . We then started work on the code itself. While it mostly went by without a hitch, we hit a roadblock near the end. The results page wouldn’t show your results! It would show things like 0/3, __/3, and even undefined/3. After nearly a full day of trying to rectify the problem, using code that wasn’t even offered to us, and asking others on Slack, we figured out it was because the results were decided before the test started! So, I figured out if we made getting to the results its own event, we could control when the results are recorded. Leonard made it when you mouseover the whole thing, and voila! A 3 question quiz about capitals of the world!! .",
