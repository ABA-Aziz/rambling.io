            "content": "The Questions and possible answers me and Leonard Wright made for the quiz. We began with planning a topic, and then discussing what would be good options to use, and the answers, one correct, three incorrect . Quiz Qs. . 1) What is the Capital of Iceland? a. &quot;Reykjavik&quot; b. “Kopavogur” c. “Akureyri” d. “Hafnarfjoerdur” 2) What is the capital of Brasil? a. “Rio di Janerio” b. &quot;Brasilia&quot; c. “Sao Paulo” d. “Lisbon” 3) What is the capital of Pakistan? a. “Lahore” b. “Karachi” c. &quot;Islamabad&quot; d. “Mumbai” . The Process . We spent the first day just working on the design of the whole thing, picking countries, finding cities, debating on how to spell Bras/zil, etc. . We then started work on the code itself. While it mostly went by without a hitch, we hit a roadblock near the end. The results page wouldn’t show your results! It would show things like 0/3, __/3, and even undefined/3. After nearly a full day of trying to rectify the problem, using code that wasn’t even offered to us, and asking others on Slack, we figured out it was because the results were decided before the test started! So, I figured out if we made getting to the results its own event, we could control when the results are recorded. Leonard made it when you mouseover the whole thing, and voila! A 3 question quiz about capitals of the world!! .",
