Computers being connected since the advent of the Internet means that people all over the world can communicate with each other, and learn about different cultures. . Cons of Computing . Privacy . The advent of social media, allowing for better communication among people has been abused by companies like Facebook, LG and Samsung who sell the data of its users to advertisers, as a massive breach of privacy . Hacking . Computing makes it easy to hack into other computers. Hacking is the act of gaining unauthorized access to another computer, often to steal information or give the target malware. The 1983 film War Games created the first anti-hacking laws after President Ronald Reagan learned it would be very easy to hack into the United States military. In 2019, Swiss developer maia arson crimew released the United States’ No Fly List after hacking into their servers, leading to the Swiss government raiding her and her parents’ houses. . Difficulty Spike . There can be a large increase in difficulty for novice programmers that can make it hard for them to break into the field. The jump from html and css to things like C++ can be jarring to new programmers. .",

The way a base 2 number system works is something is either 1 or 0, and the placement determines the power of 2 used, starting with 0. 1 is binary for 1. 10 is binary for 2, 10110 is 22 etc. Most computers use an 8 bit binary, so it goes from 2^0 (1) to 2^7 (128). . Abstraction . Abstraction is the filtering of items that are irrelevant to a task. When the source code on a webpage is viewed (usually by pressing Ctrl+U on a Windows or Option+Cmnd+U on a Mac), much of the code is abstracted to show only what the webpage needs to show. . So What? . Binary and Abstraction work together to make computers work. ASCII, for example, abstracts 8 bits of binary to make characters, usually on a keyboard. The two are indispensible together. .",

            "content": "Script . Okay, let’s do this thing. We’re working on Jeopardy, everything is in progress. . Software Development . Life Cycle . We started with coming up with ideas. And by that I mean me and Leonard came up with ideas while Jonathan gave his opinions on some of them. We eventually decided on my idea of a Jeopardy-style game. We then spent a long while discussing the aesthetics and the questions. I started a concept sheet to come up with questions and ways to figure everything out. Of the 49 questions we ended up using, I wrote 41, Jonathan wrote 5 and Leonard wrote 3. We then programmed for format and databases. . Updates . We mark our progress through major breakthrougs. Uploading the sounds to use in the files, finishing the dictionary, etc. We mark the changelog through these. Version 1.0 is the initial thing. 1.1 is when we started uploading, 2.0 when the dictionary is done, and 3.0 when the sounds were added. . Agile Process . We searched up Jeopardy for how to make the board. When I was surfing the internet, I found the sounds we could use, and I’m pretty sure Toei doesn’t trademark those sounds because they’re from before 2012 so they’re not songs. . Requirements . Computer Specs . The game was mostly developed on a 2020 Lenovo Legion 5 on an i7 core. This is as much information that I could glean. . Tracking . I have a scrum board. . Speedrun Strats . I asked a bunch of people the questions we have to determine difficulty, and we held daily meetings over how to go over things. The Jeopardy theme song is copyrighted, for example, so we had to use other sounds. I got a bunch of sounds off the internet that I don’t think Toei will mind if we use, considering they haven’t taken down the videos yet, and the sounds are from 2003 and 2004. . Demo . Github Issues . We don’t have that. . Expectations . We have a table of buttons, and when you click one, it goes to a question that you must answer. If wrong, it plays the mp3 files “Standing By 1” and when correct, plays “Turn Up 1”. .",

I’m considering asking someone else, but I really don’t feel like doing that. . Work . API has been found. Trivia by API-Ninjas, which was found by our DevOp Leonard Wright. I’ve been on top of the Scrum Board, and I’m honestly not sure what Martin and Jonathan have done so far. Martin has volunteered to write a few of the backup questions for other rounds, but I feel that was mostly because he has done literally nothing and doesn’t want his grade to go down. He is a developer, though, so that should be fun for him. . Problems . We’ve been trying to find a way to get the whole thing to work. It pushes but doesn’t pull or vice versa. On a personal note, my github doesn’t accept things from here for some reason. So…yeah. .",

We still have to actually program it though, but I think the “tabulate” thing on Python should help with that. We also need to think of the aesthetics, because a silent game with no…vibes…is boring. . Work . I’ve been trying to find an API to do some work on.

The Process . We spent the first day just working on the design of the whole thing, picking countries, finding cities, debating on how to spell Bras/zil, etc. . We then started work on the code itself. While it mostly went by without a hitch, we hit a roadblock near the end. The results page wouldn’t show your results! It would show things like 0/3, __/3, and even undefined/3. After nearly a full day of trying to rectify the problem, using code that wasn’t even offered to us, and asking others on Slack, we figured out it was because the results were decided before the test started! So, I figured out if we made getting to the results its own event, we could control when the results are recorded. Leonard made it when you mouseover the whole thing, and voila! A 3 question quiz about capitals of the world!! .",
