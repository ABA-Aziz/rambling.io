# Review

I took the take home test on Friday and Monday before the final. My inexperience in the matter, coupled with my rush to get it done to do this led me to perform poorly on it. It asked questions of the early days when I had no idea what I was doing, and I barely got by on the binary questions solely through knowing how base 2 works. While I thought most of the questions weren't that hard, it could have simply been me being overcofident and going through the questions without thinking about what they were saying. The gap between me doing the first half and second half might have also had something to do with it, although considering my performance, that might not be true.

All in all, it was a humbling experience, and I wish I could have done better in it.
